// Deque optimization is basically used for maintaining elemnts in a sorted order for a given condition and main point is that it maintain indixes in sorted order not elemnts  

while(!d1.empty() && v1[d1.back()]>=sum){        sum here is the condition to satisfy 
               d1.pop_back();
           }

d1.push_back(i);
